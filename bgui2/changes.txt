	Released of the library under a gift-ware license
BGui v2.0.2 -- 20 Jan 2001:
    Jason Winnebeck:
	Quickly added ability for editboxes and listboxes to be D_DISABLED
BGui v2.0.1 -- 19 Oct 2000:
    Jason Winnebeck:
        Reformatted the text files -- they were wrapped to 88 characters, not
        78.  Added .sh and .bat files to convert text types and copy the
        proper makefile to Makefile.

        Fixed btest.c to not lock up in Windows when taking a screen shot.
        Removed ununsed variables (got rid of some warnings).

    Chris de Sousa:
        Added 2 makefiles, 1 for dos and 1 for linux.

        Made a few changes to btest.c to make it compile with glibc,
        the itoa function is not standard, so i used sprintf instead.

        Also changed the structure a bit, sources in src/, docs in /docs,
        libs in /lib.
