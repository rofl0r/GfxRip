THIS LIBRARY HAS BEEN RELEASED UNOFFICCALLY BY JASON WINNEBECK, PLEASE READ README!.TXT
FOR MORE INFO.  This is the orginal version of the readme file and much does not apply.
The new changes file is part of README!.TXT.

changes in BGui release 1.0:

- Fixed a little bug in billfs.c
  with the alert box.

- Cut calls to get_bill_color in
  half in the TDBox routine.

- BillCheck now responds to D_DISABLED
  (Thanks Julien Audran!)

- Fixed bug in BillWindow (it didn't check
  if it's temp. bitmap was sucessfully
  allocated)  (how stupid of me :-)

- Added BillGroupBox (Thanks Julien Audran!)

- Added Drop Down List (Thanks Julien Audran!)

- Added progress bar.

- Radio buttons are now square if the button's
  d2 is 1.

- As of this release, BGui no longer comes with
  a precompiled version.  This was a stupid idea --
  differences b/t Allegro versions caused the
  precompiled one  to fail on many systems.  It
  was a great way to get feedback (It doesn't work!)
  messages from users, though :-)

- Ripped bill_fade_bmp out of GenMedia (See my page)
  for BGui.  It's like on the Win95 shutdown thing.

changes in BGui releases 0 to .9:

- Updated the graphics mode
  selection dialog to reflect
  the new drivers available in
  WIP 25.

- Updated the file selection
  dialog to work better, like
  the one in WIP 25 it now only
  shows available drives.

- The menu bug is now fixed.
  Please let me know of any
  more problems you find.

- "Modularized" the files --
  BGui is no longer just one
  BIG file

- Now you can use "MODE_EXACTWIN"
  and "MODE_ALLEGCOMPAT" with
  set_gui_mode.

- BillButtons now respond to D_DISABLED
  by making their text grey

- Callback BillButtons no longer redraw
  the entire dialog when the "pop up", they
  just redraw themselves.

- Scroll Bars now are "invisible" if they
  have a d1 value of 0.  The do NOT respond
  to D_HIDDEN.  They will no longer crash
  with a d1 of 0.

- I added a d_billscrollablebitmap_proc.

- Johan J”nsson added a vertical 3D line.

- Added the plain callback button.

- The Sound Callback button works
  now.

- BGui now hides the mouse during
  the drawing of ALL of the controls.
  (I think :-)

- BillWindows now respond to
  MODE_EXACTWIN by making their
  title bars larger. There is now
  plenty of room to put a button
  with an "X" on the title bar.

- Created BMake.bat
